# DeepNeural_Real-time-Image-Recognition
MobileNets: Efficient (deep) neural networks. It will work fine on raspberry pi and smartphone cameras. Pre-trained model : SSD by GOOGLE  
Just clone it or download it .
Change the directory to the project file and run this <python3 real_time_object_detection.py -p MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt -m MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel>
And you are good to go..:D!!
